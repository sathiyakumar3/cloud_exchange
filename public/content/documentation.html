  									<p class="mb-10 txt-dark">Cloud Exchange facilitates your IoT requirements and helps to bypass all the development and designing or building and leads straight to deploying IoT solutions. With just few clicks we enable to connect your devices or data to the cloud.
									  In just five minutes and without any technical skill or private social IoT platform for their building.</p><p> In fusing together Cloud Exchange IoT platform and our Engineering team you can create your own social IoT network extending beyond one&rsquo;s vision or potential.
									  We automate each of the difficult steps that are required to generate IoT dashboards populated with graphs, charts, control switches, maps, tables, and countless other widgets are the digital tools &ndash; we use to visualize and display data coming from the physical to your fingertips.&nbsp;</p><br>
									  <p>If a poorly secured IoT device can be compromised, and it is connected to your business netowk, it can do serious damage! That&rsquo;s we have tied up with Google.</p>
									  <p>Cloud Exchange is powered by Google IoT and Firebase. Cloud IoT Core supports traditional MQTT and HTTP protocols, which allows clients to make use of a lot of the existing devices to build their IoT networks. This package works in the Google infrastructure that automatically scales in real time while making possible secure connection of a million devices if required. It helps to Implement a secure and scalable hardware root of trust authentication for your Google Cloud IoT Core connection. The solution provides a cost-effective approach with tampering protections on the private keys.</p>

  									<p class="mb-20"><p>Fundamentally you will need a site - technically, a folder to place all your devices. However, a Public Folder is readily available in navigation tree, called Cloud_Exchange However please be advised this is a community folder, which means your data is not secure. It is only recommended for testing or learning. Though It is not necessary to create a new site for each user, you can request access for existing sites, for which the approvals are required from the site administrators or the owners. Administrators play a crucial part in maintaining the sites. Please also note that the public site : Cloud_Exchange has no owners, or administrators.</p>
									  <p>Every user must select the role he or she is to play in every Site.</p></p>

										<li class="mb-10 txt-dark" >Owner<code>– Owns of the site, Monitoring and Management of all users, devices and the site itself. </code></li>
									</ul>

  									<p><p>Generally, the Member is the user to whom the collected data is intended for, hence all the implementation part is played by the administrators and developers. Administrator generally controls the users&rsquo; access to the site. The site access requests are directed to the administrator for approvals. Even after the approval, the administrator has rights to revoke access to the site at any given time.</p>
									  <p>Developer on the hand, has access to the control of the devices in a site. A developer is responsible for writing the middleware to get the intended data to the cloud. <a class= "text-primary" href="http://jdewit.github.com/bootstrap-timepicker">How to write a middleware to get the intended data to the cloud?</a></p>

									<ul class="uo-list mt-20 mb-20 pl-15">

									</ul>
									<p>Along with the above credentials, the following parameters are also required. This is mainly for security.</p>
									<ul class="uo-list mt-20 mb-20 pl-15">
										<li class="mb-10 txt-dark" >Public Key <code>– This is usually generated in key pairs. Public Key and Private Key. Public keys are generally opened to the public, as the name suggests.  On the other hand, the Private Key must remain confidential to its respective owner. Because the key pair is mathematically related, whatever is encrypted with a Public Key may only be decrypted by its corresponding Private Key and vice versa. As the public key is fed the cloud exchange, the private key must be fed to the device. Note that the cloud exchange doesn’t accept private keys.  </code></li>
										<li class="mb-10 txt-dark" >Public Key Format  <code>– Cloud Exchange supports four formats of public key, RSA_PEM, RSA_X509_PEM, ES256_PEM and ES256_X509_PEM. </code></li>
									</ul>
									<p>When creating a device, the device type plays a very important role of directing to the right dashboards, each dashboard is custom made and fine tuned to suit the application. Our dashboards range from energy monitoring to monitoring comforts conditions.<br><br><strong>If you are unable to find a dashboard of your requirements please let us know your expectation, we will create one for you. &ndash; <a class= "text-primary" href="http://jdewit.github.com/bootstrap-timepicker">Talk to us.</a></strong></p>
